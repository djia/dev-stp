# Dev-STP

Developmental depression-facilitation shift controls excitation-inhibition balance.

Developmental STP simulation files.

## Installation requirements

* Python version 2.7
* NeuroTools
* [superjson](https://pypi.org/project/superjson/) version 0.0.10
* Brian Simulation version 2
* Numpy
* Scipy
* matplotlib

## Running the simulation

* After installation of the required libraries, simply type
```
python run.py
```
* Make sure you are using Python 2.

Note: the first time you run the model it takes some extra time to setup the system before you see some output.

Note2: due to computational constraints of standard personal computers, the code is initialized to run the dev-STP model for only 100s of simulated time. The effects of the dev-STP model can already be observed during this time.
